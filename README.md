## Code Overview
- transcribe_audio_in_chunks(audio_file_path): Processes audio in chunks for better recognition, using Googleâ€™s speech recognition API.
- transcribe_selected_videos(video_file_paths): Extracts audio from selected video files and performs transcription.
- select_video_files(): Opens a file dialog to select video files.
- stop_transcription(): Stops the transcription process if it's currently running.

## Example
After running the application, you'll see a window where you can:
- Select MP4 or MOV files to transcribe their audio content.
- Stop the transcription process at any time.

Error Handling
The app handles various exceptions, including:
- API request errors: Issues with the speech recognition API.
- General errors: Any unexpected issues during processing. If an error occurs, an appropriate message will be shown in a dialog box.
- Threading is implemented to prevent the Tkinter GUI from becoming unresponsive during transcription. 
- The audio is transcribed in 60-second increments to avoid crashes with large video files.
